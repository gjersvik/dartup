          <h1>The Mission</h1>
          Enable easy and frictionless hosting of Dart applications and services.
          In an open and community driven way.

          <h2>Easy and frictionless</h2>
          It should be easy for anyone to run a full stack Dart application. So
          your goal is to give easy choices that matters first. Still give you
          the power and control you need when you application grows. In a
          perfect world you should be able just give us code and a budget and
          we handle the rest.

          <h2>Open Source Startup</h2>
          I have done the secret build up a big project stealth mode startup
          and it was a pain. This time I want swing the pendulum the other way
          and be as open and transparent as possible. The rule of thumb should
          be, the only thing secret are the keys and customer data.

          <h2>For the community</h2>
          In the end its all about you guys and girls in the Dart community.
          The goal of this enterprise is to help the Dart community not to make
          a few of us rich. So we will seek input on almost everything. But we
          will not necessarily blindly follow the majority. And if the
          community allows it we would like to give hosting to even the ones
          with a zero budget to help Dart grow.

          <h2>Accelerated on Amazon Web Services</h2>
          Why build everything from scratch when you stand on shoulders of
          giants and in host/cloud business there is none bigger. With AWS as
          the base we can get to the market quicker and better than doing all
          inhouse. It also has the positive effect for  you to have access to
          the extensive ecosystem that has buildup around AWS. This is where we
          will start but where we go be will mostly up to you the community.

          <h1>The Roadmap</h1>
          Minimum product to positive cash flow to community guided reinvestment.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
          <h2>Minimum product</h2>
          The plan is to first create a simple hostings service for static
          pages created with Dart. Like webpages or games. That is something
          that I should be able to build quickly. It will be free of charge for
          a limited customer base. I dont have the money to host a flash mob
          out of pocket. I know that most of you want Dart server hosting. But
          releasing something useful early has two purposes. First to be a
          focus point for feedback and improvements. The second is to show
          myself and the world that I’m serious. Talk is cheap.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
          <h2>Positive cash flow.</h2>
          After the initial product offering the next goal is to get to a state
          where I no longer pay out of pocket. To reach that will be a
          combination of necessary steps and implementing requested features.
          The trick is to complete this without increasing my cost
          substantially but still make something worth paying for. I have some
          ideas but do not want to get ahead of myself.

          <h2>Community guided reinvestment.</h2>
          Now we are really in business and can start to chip away on the most
          requested features as money and time becomes available. To create a
          good host and/or open source project.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
          <h2>Profit?</h2>
          Not really a goal. The dream is to be able to work on this full time
          and earn a market salary. But as I see it the money that customers
          put in are there to make Dartup better. But you know money corrupts
          so we will see. Muahahaha.
